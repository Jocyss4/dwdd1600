    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Fashion starts from either a trend or a <strong>social statement</strong>, this is the case for Chicano Fashion. It came to rise because of the <em>Pachuco style</em> that became popular in the 1930-40's. It took inspiration from the zoot suits aesthetic. Who at the time were being targeted during the series of the Zoot Suit Riots. This then started a movement to bring what caused Chicano's the most harm and turn it into their defining weapon of sorts. This evolved into the existence of the Chicano Style that we know today. It is very bold and stands out greatly to signify that they won't let others take advanatge of them by the way they look. That looking different than everyone else doesn't make them different, but unites them as one <em>community</em>.</p>
    <p><a href="designers.html#sign">The top trending designers</a> are very quickly coming more into the <em>limelight</em>, especially with the rise of more chicano artist wearing and displaying them at their concerts or events. The Chicano fashion is more than just clothes, it is a type of lifestlye. Most people think about the gang related baggy oversize look when they think of Chicano fashion. Yes, most designers today encapsulate that, but it is all due to thier culture and upbringing. No matter the period though retro refrences have become the spotlight of pride and acts of hope. The reason why this fashion trend carries through the years is because of the need to share with the future generations, "We exsisted. We were here and will remain."

    <h2>How Zoot Suits started the Chicano Movement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>As the zoot suits became more popular among young minority communities, it also gave them a racist reputation. 

            </li>
            <li>Local papers framed the racial attacks as a vigilante response to an immigrant crime wave, and police generally restricted their arrests to the Latinos who fought back.

            </li>
            <li> During this time you would think that they were more scared to wear the suits, but it actually increased the usage of the suits. This emphasized their sense of justice prevailing in making this a statement.</li>
