        <h2>Top Brands</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>FB County</dt>
            <dd>This brand is known for its very <em>cholo</em> style refrencing the baggy trousers and the classic flannels, that come from the gang related part of the Chicano Culture. They have signature colors such as red, black, and yellow, that really help them stand out from many other brands. This brand is one of the classics, with being catogorized as the first known Chicano brand to breakthrough into the limelight.</dd>
            <dt>Ghetto Rodeo</dt>
            <dd>Ghetto Rodeo is known for being a brand that is influenced by not only the culture, but by the personal experiences that Chicano's live through on a day by day bases. They encapsulate this through graohics and typography as well. Not only is this more and more imapctufl, but it garners the publics attention to the brand and help young graphic designers get their work recognized as well, as they are known to make collaborations with different designers.</dd>
            <dt>Chubby Chicano</dt>
            <dd>Chubby Chicano recently came out in the spotlight for making custom clothing for an artist by the name of <strong>Becky G</strong>. Their one of a kind custom pieces have caused quite the stir in the fashion scene. What sets this brand apart is that they thrift all the items they sell and they customize them, making them truly one of a kind. Another thing that this brand has that attracts a lot of attention is that even with the folowing and the size of attention they garner it remains a really mysterious brand. One thing that is not a mystery is how great their designs transcend time and creativity.</dd>

        <h2>Chicano's on The Rise</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Why are these designers garnering atttention?</dt>
            <dd>It mainly has to do with the story they have to tell. Yes, the history and the likely hood of them having a personal or direct tie to the culture. Yet, it is also about the way that they express all of that through their designs.</dd>
            <dt>What designs have made an impact?</dt>
            <dd>Defintely think that a certain piece from Ghetto Rodeo specifically has garnerd a lot of attention. This piece has to do with giving men flowers before they pass away. Often times in the chicano culture they grew up with a very manly way of seeing things. Things such as flowers are only for women and etc. This specific shirt helps the new generation heal from that and Bryan Salcedo does so in a personal way. Envoking this emotion by the picture of him and his brother with roots of roses, that really sends the messge across on a deeper level.</dd>
